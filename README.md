# 🏠 Boston House Price Prediction

This beginner-level project is part of the ShadowFox AIML Internship. It uses machine learning to predict house prices in Boston using the Boston Housing dataset.

## 📌 Objective
Build a regression model that predicts house prices (`MEDV`) based on features like:
- crime rate (CRIM)
- number of rooms (RM)
- accessibility to highways (RAD)
- tax rate (TAX)
- and more...

## 💻 Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🧠 Steps Involved
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Handle non-numeric data and missing values
3. Visualize feature correlation
4. Train-test split (80/20)
5. Build Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate with MSE and R² Score
7. Plot predicted vs actual house prices

## 📊 Results
- ✅ Model trained successfully
- ✅ Plotted actual vs predicted prices
- ✅ Achieved an R² score around 0.7–0.8
